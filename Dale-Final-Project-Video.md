# Overview

This page provide's an overview of Dale's contribution to the AESD Final Project "Vendotron"

# Video Outline

The video demonstrates:
* Device Power on
* Starting Identity Mock Service
* Start hardware integration
* Hardware integration makes call to Mock API
* Discussion of issues

## Challenges
My most difficult challenge when implementing this project were:
* Figuring out how to integrate Python in Buildroot, seems very opinionated
* I made mistakes with initial architecture leading to lost time
* I overscope for my availability, had less availability than I'd planned

## Lessons Learned
The most important topics I learned from this project were:
* Either build everything in C/C++ or dig deep into how Buildroot handles Python libraries
* Hardware integration steps with the Raspberry Pi, the I2C enable steps were entirely new to me
* OBS is a lot easier than I was expecting, it would have made my other course demos much cleaner
